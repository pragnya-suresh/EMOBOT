48,"Did you actually know this?
Exactly one century before Greta was born, her ancestor on her father’s side, the renowned scientist Svante Arrhenius, was the first Swede to win the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. It was Arrhenius who also discovered the principles of the greenhouse effect: as early as 1896, he described that man-made CO2 emissions were large enough to cause global warming! 
Why are scientific findings that were been recognized and appreciated hundred years ago ignored today??? Is humanity now really become so stupid??? 
Today, Greta continues the work of her famous ancestor! Now Greta should receive the Nobel Prize!!!",0.9403250193806214
